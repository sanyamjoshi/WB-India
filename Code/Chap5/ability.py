    This function generates the 80 x 7 matrix of lifetime earnings
    ability profiles, corresponding to annual ages from 21 to 100 and to
    paths based on income percentiles 0-25, 25-50, 50-70, 70-80, 80-90,
    90-99, 99-100. The ergodic population distribution is an input in
    order to rescale the paths so that the weighted average equals 1.

    The data come from the following file:

        data/ability/FR_wage_profile_tables.xlsx

    The polynomials are of the form

        log(abil) = const + (one)(age) + (two)(age)^2 + (three)(age)^3

    Values come from regression analysis using IRS CWHS with hours
    imputed from the CPS.
